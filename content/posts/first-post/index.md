Tian is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go, and designed to make website creation fun again.
<!--more-->
Tian is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking, Tian is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page with each visitor request, Tian builds pages when you create or update your content. Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Tian is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience for your website’s end users and an ideal writing experience for website authors.

Websites built with Tian are extremely fast and secure. Tian sites can be hosted anywhere, including Netlify, Heroku, GoDaddy, DreamHost, GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, Surge, Aerobatic, Firebase, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, Rackspace, Azure, and CloudFront and work well with CDNs. Tian sites run without the need for a database or dependencies on expensive runtimes like Ruby, Python, or PHP.

We think of Tian as the ideal website creation tool with nearly instant build times, able to rebuild whenever a change is made.
